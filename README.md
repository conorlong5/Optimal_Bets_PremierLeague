# Optimal Bet for English Premier League: B.S. Thesis, ITAM

Optimal betting algorithm to set the optimal stake amount to maximize profit
subject to minimum risk.

The algorithm is divided in two parts:

1. With historical data from teams and books, get the personal probabilities
of each match of being Home win, Away win or Draw using Neural Networks.

2. With own odds, compare with books and use Kelly Criterion and Markowitz
to optimize the stake amount.

**Bachelors' thesis to obtain the title of Applied Mathematician.**
